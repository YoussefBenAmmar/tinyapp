## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

## How to:

- TinyApp is easy to use. First create an account, don't worry your information is secured we've used hashing technology to keep your password safe.
- Once you've created an account you'll automatically enter the welcome page. If you want to leave you can just log out and log in at any time. But don't leave now, it's about to get fun....
- Here you have all the tiny Urls you've created. All 0 of them. Because yes you have to create some to see some. Das is how it works. Click on "Create New URL".
- Copy and paste the URL of you choice, it can be as long as you want and we'll apply our secret sauce and deliver a 6 strings URL, that you can share on any bird logo platform with limited characters. 
- When you go back to your home page you'll be able to delete or edit the URL. 
- Finally if you try to change the URL and you're not logged in, well you can't. I told you, your precious URLs are safe with us.
- Have fun. 

## Words from the Developer: 

- This was an interesting project. Creating it 4 days was a definitely a challenge but also a great way to learn a ton of things. 
- Some instructions were a bit daunting at first, but once you jump into it, it starts to make sense. I have to confess, I didn't expect it to be that much work to make such a simple site. My respect for web developers keeps rising. 


## Words from the Developer (Me) to the future Developer (Me): 
- This was your first project. You've set a reminder to look back at it in a year. Hopefully it'll be an opportunity to look back and appreciate the progess. Cheers.
